    "output": "Kickball is a game where players on two teams compete to kick a large ball across a field and into a goal.  The object is to kick the ball as far as possible, and the game is usually played with nine players on each team.  The goal of each team is to kick the ball into the other team’s goal, and the game is won by the team with the most goals.  Here is a basic overview of how the game is played:\n\n1.  Teams line up on opposite sides of the field, and the goalie is placed in the goal.\n\n2.  The ball is thrown by one player from each team to the other, and each team tries to kick the ball across the field and into the goal.\n\n3.  Players can be substituted at any time during the game, and players on each team can take turns kicking the ball.\n\n4.

The box you want to wrap the present in should be rectangular, and it’s important that the paper matches that shape.  To do this, the paper should be folded in half, with one corner folded inwards.  Then you can fold that corner inwards again, to get the fold that you need.  You should fold it in half a few times, so that the paper is nice and tight.  Then you can fold it along its width to get a square shape.  Then you can fold it in half again along its length to get a rectangular box.  Now you can tape it shut and put the present inside, and it should look nice and neat!",

    "output": "Dicing is a great cooking skill!  There are several techniques for safely dicing without cutting your finger.  One option is to use a vegetable peeler to remove the peel from the fruit or vegetable and then cut into thin strips.  Alternatively, a sharp paring knife can be used to slice the food into dice-sized cubes.  A third option is to cut the fruit or vegetable into small squares and then cut the squares into diced pieces.  You can also dice vegetables like carrots, onions, and cabbage using a food processor or food chopper, which is much faster than the other methods and allows you to get the diced pieces to your desired size.  To further increase safety, use the cutting board as a barrier between your fingers and the sharp knife, and wear gloves when using a vegetable peeler or paring knife.  Enjoy cooking!",

For example, the clue \"Female sheep\" might eliminate answers like \"RAM\", \"PORCUPINE\", and \"CANINE\".\n\n-There are often \"theme answers\" that you need to solve a specific clue, such as \"Soccer\" for the clue \"Mother of two\" or \"Four-legged creature\" for the clue \"Natural enemy of a cat\".\n\n-To enter your answers into the grid, you use the \"down\" direction to move from left to right, and the \"across\" direction to move from top to bottom.  You can tell if your answer is right by seeing if it matches up with the clue.\n\nI hope these tips help!",

These cows are prized for their unique flavor, but they’re also incredibly difficult to raise and feed.  Because of this, and because there are so few of them, kobe beef is extremely rare and expensive.  Additionally, kobe beef is only aged for two years, which is much shorter than the usual four to five years that most beef is aged for.

This heat and pressure can cause the crust to fracture and volcanoes can form.  Volcanoes can also be caused by other processes, like the injection of magma from deep within the Earth, or the rupturing of volcanic dikes.  Volcanoes can also form due to the melting of ice or snow, which causes gases to rise and erupt from the Earth’s surface.",

For example, you could try setting a rule for yourself that you won’t check your phone in the first ten minutes after you wake up, or in the last ten minutes before you go to bed.  You could also try putting your phone in airplane mode for a set period of time every day.  These kinds of restrictions can help you break the habit of constantly checking your phone, and they can also help you make better use of your time.  In general, it’s a good idea to try to be conscious about how you use your phone, and try to be mindful about when you check it and for how long.  That way, you can use it in a healthier and more balanced way.",

    "output": "This discovery goes back to the early Greeks, about 2,500 years ago.  In fact, many of the early Greeks were aware of the sphericity of the earth, including Pythagoras, who developed mathematical theories supporting the idea.  However, most of the people living at the time believed the earth was flat, for several reasons.  First, they were surrounded by water, which they thought extended indefinitely to the horizon.  Second, they had the sun, moon, and stars in the sky above them, which they perceived as perfectly round, and so they reasoned that the earth must be a similar shape.  In addition, the sea appeared to be level, which suggested a flat earth to them.  Finally, they had travelers’ tales about adventurers who had reached the end of the earth, and who described a flat surface there.  All of these factors combined to lead people to believe that the earth was flat.  However, there were some dissenters from this idea as well, including Aristotle, who argued that the earth was spherical.  Interestingly, Aristotle’s arguments were not based on any direct observations of the earth’s shape, but instead on mathematical reasoning.  He showed that if the earth was flat, then the moon would be closer to us than it really is, and this led him to conclude that the earth must be round.  So even in the ancient world, some people were aware that the earth was spherical, but this idea did not become widely accepted until much later.",

It is made with a mixture of finely chopped fresh herbs and spices, including parsley, garlic, and/or lemon zest, plus a variety of other ingredients.  The key ingredient of gremolata is often lemon zest, which lends a subtle citrus flavor to the mixture.  Gremolata is traditionally used as a finishing touch on many dishes, including seafood and pasta, but can also be incorporated into breads and vegetable dishes.  It is generally served either as a condiment or as a garnish, and has a bright, tangy flavor that complements many different types of dishes.  Gremolata is also a common ingredient in a number of classic Italian and Mediterranean salad dressings and sauces.  Some popular variations on the basic gremolata mixture include lemon-pepper gremolata, which uses lemon peel in addition to lemon zest, and garlic-herb gremolata, which substitutes garlic for some of the lemon zest.",

They don’t believe in God or Satan because there’s no evidence for either of them in the natural world.  Some people believe in God or Satan because of their religious beliefs, but that’s a completely different matter than science.  Science can explain how things work in the natural world, and it can’t explain whether or not there’s a supernatural being like God or Satan.  Some people also believe in God because they want to feel a sense of connection to something greater than themselves, or to believe that there’s some kind of cosmic justice, but science can’t explain that either.  Ultimately, whether or not you believe in God or Satan is a matter of faith and personal belief, rather than a scientific question.",

The two had a daughter together.  But Caesar had a mistress as well, named Cleopatra.  Cleopatra was the Queen of Egypt, and was one of the last of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for three centuries.  In the time of Julius Caesar, the Ptolemaic dynasty was declining, but Cleopatra was still very powerful.  She sought to gain influence by forming an alliance with Caesar.  She visited him in Rome, and he fell in love with her.  He returned to Egypt with her, and they had a son together.  But this was very controversial, since Cleopatra was not Caesar’s wife.  His wife, the daughter of the Roman leader, was a Roman aristocrat, and not from a foreign, alien culture.  In the end, Julius Caesar divorced his wife and married Cleopatra, and he became the father of the Egyptian pharaohs.  This was very controversial in Roman society, but Cleopatra’s power and charisma were very strong, and she was able to make this happen.  After Julius Caesar was assassinated, Cleopatra committed suicide.  The son that Caesar and Cleopatra had together, Caesarion, was declared pharaoh, but he was assassinated shortly after that.  Julius Caesar and Cleopatra had a very tumultuous, dramatic, and controversial relationship.",

    "instruction": "Best way to defrost a refrigerator freezer?",
    "output": "There are many ways to defrost a refrigerator freezer, and each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.  The most common methods include letting the unit run on a “defrost” setting, allowing warm air to circulate inside, or manually removing ice and melting it with warm water.  The best way to defrost a refrigerator freezer is to simply wait until the unit’s built-in timer shuts off the automatic defrost cycle, at which point you can manually remove the ice with a spatula.  You can also speed up the process of defrosting a freezer by simply opening the door and turning the unit off for 10-15 minutes.  However, if you frequently use your refrigerator freezer, you should consider investing in a manual defrost unit to save time and effort.  Manual defrost units allow you to easily remove ice from the refrigerator’s interior by simply opening the front of the unit.  Manual defrost units are ideal for homes that use their refrigerator-freezer often.  Ultimately, the best way to defrost a refrigerator freezer depends on your usage habits and the amount of ice that has built up.  You should speak to a technician or the manufacturer for more advice about which method is best for your situation.  Good luck!",

    "output": "Octane ratings refer to the resistance of gasoline to self-ignition.  The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the gas is to combustion, and the less likely it is to catch fire spontaneously.  This is especially important for automobiles, which rely on compression to ignite the fuel.  Octane ratings are generally correlated with the volatility of the gasoline, as more volatile gasoline will be more likely to catch fire.  Gasoline with higher octane ratings is typically more expensive, as it is more difficult to produce and requires more processing.  The octane ratings for automotive gasoline in the United States range from 87 to 100, with 87 being the lowest octane and 100 being the highest.",

They’re very messy, so it’s a good idea to provide a litterbox, and to clean it regularly.  Rats need a healthy diet, including fresh vegetables and fruits, as well as a high-quality rat food.  Make sure the food you buy is designed for rats, since they have very specific nutritional needs.  Rats can be trained, so you can teach them tricks, and you can play with them and interact with them in lots of fun ways.  Rats make wonderful pets, and I think you’ll enjoy having one!",

The objective is to score more goals than the opponent, with each team trying to prevent the other from scoring.  The game is officiated by two referees, who enforce the rules of the game.  The equipment used includes skates, a stick, and protective equipment such as helmets and pads.  Each team has a goaltender, who stands in a goal at the opposite end of the ice rink from the other players, and tries to prevent the puck from entering the goal.  The game is divided into three periods of twenty minutes each, with a break at half-time of fifteen minutes.  During the game, players attempt to control the puck using their sticks, passing it between themselves and attempting to shoot it into the goal.  The team that scores the most goals wins the game.  The rules of the game are enforced by the referees, and the players must abide by these rules or risk being penalized by the referees.  The players also attempt to prevent their opponents from scoring, by blocking their shots or tackling them when they are carrying the puck.  The game is played on an ice rink, which is a large rectangular surface of frozen water.  The rinks are surrounded by walls and seating for spectators.",

    "output": "It’s possible to grow some vegetables and fruits indoors year-round, but the indoor growing environment is very different from a traditional outdoor garden, so there are a lot of important factors to consider.  The main challenge with indoor growing is lighting.  To provide adequate light for plants, you need to have strong lighting systems, either from artificial grow lights or from skylights.  Additionally, indoor growing requires careful climate control.  Plants require a specific range of temperature and humidity, and in general it’s important to maintain a warm and humid environment.  So, in terms of the basics, indoor growing requires a lot of specialized equipment.  However, some people grow their own food indoors using small window sills or other low-cost setups.  In those situations, the plant needs to be kept in a very warm and humid environment and you’ll need to use artificial lighting.  The main problem with this method is that it can be very difficult to maintain the ideal growing environment.  It’s possible to grow some leafy greens or herbs indoors, but it can be very difficult to grow vegetables or fruits indoors.  For example, to grow tomatoes indoors, you’ll need to build a special climate-controlled room, which can be expensive.  The best results will come from a system that includes artificial lighting, and that also provides a humid and warm environment.  With the proper setup, you can grow many vegetables, fruits, and herbs indoors, but it can be expensive, and it can also be very time-consuming.",

The color of a pearl depends on the color of the shell, and may be white, black, pink, or other colors.  Pearls have long been prized for their beauty and rarity, and were once highly valuable, but are now commonly found in aquaculture, which breeds mollusks specifically for the purpose of harvesting their pearls.

For example, if we start at the top left corner of the rectangle, you can put a “1” in the upper left corner, a “2” in the upper right corner, a “3” in the lower left corner, and a “4” in the lower right corner.  The rest of the squares can be filled in in a similar manner.  Here’s an example:",

You might be thinking of a d40 die, which is shaped like a regular d20, but with sides numbered from 1 to 40.  To find the area of a 20 sided die, we’ll first need to figure out how many faces it has.  A regular 20 sided die has 20 sides, so the area of a regular 20 sided die is simply 20 * 20 = 4000 square inches.  A d40 die, however, has 40 sides, so the area of a d40 die is 40 * 40 = 16000 square inches.  Hope that helps!",

The other cats all have their own feelings and opinions about the matter.

You could also try putting a loud alarm or water spray in the garden to deter the other cat.  Another possibility would be to try putting a deterrent like ammonia or citrus in the garden, although this might make your own cat feel uncomfortable too.  A humane way to discourage cats from fighting is to feed them separately with food they both like, but make sure both cats get enough food and they don't fight over it.  If that doesn't work, you might want to contact your local animal shelter for advice on how to safely deal with cats who fight.",

Most people’s eyes can adapt to darkness within 15-30 minutes, but a small number may require up to an hour.  There are a number of factors that influence how long it takes to fully adapt to darkness, including general health and diet, sleep patterns, and how recently the eyes were exposed to bright light.  It’s also important to note that adaptation is typically much faster if you gradually shift from a bright environment to a dark one, rather than suddenly switching from a bright environment to complete darkness.  In either case, it’s always best to give your eyes time to adjust before performing any activities that require good vision, such as reading, driving, or working on a computer.  You can further accelerate adaptation by reducing other visual stimuli, such as turning off electronic devices or reducing light from nearby windows.  In the end, the optimal strategy is to allow plenty of time for full adaptation before performing visual tasks that require good vision, as it can take up to an hour for the eyes to fully adapt to darkness.

You want the exterior to be nicely browned, and the interior to be cooked to medium-rare.  The best way to ensure the interior is cooked to your desired doneness is to use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the center of the steak, and then remove it from the oven when it is cooked to your desired doneness.  For a juicy, medium-rare steak, you want the center to be about 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit.  Hope that helps!  Best of luck with your steak cooking!",

A major advantage of banks is that they are a central institution for financial transactions, and they have access to both funds on deposit and the ability to quickly access new funds.  In this sense, banks serve an important role in the economy.  However, this advantage can also be a source of instability, as the money available to banks can fluctuate significantly depending on the availability of funds on deposit.  One way to counter this problem is to use additional reserves, or a \"capital buffer\", to help manage risk.  In this sense, banks would be more stable, but could also have less flexibility in the management of funds.

I'll be graduating in May, and planning to apply to PhD programs in the US at the end of the year in order to start August 2024. I'm thinking of what to do/study during this year until my program starts. Could you give me ideas? Feel free to ask me for questions which would help you give me better suggestions.",
    "output": "Congratulations on finishing your undergraduate degree!  That’s a great accomplishment, and you should be proud.  Now it’s time to think about your next steps.  You’re interested in pursuing a PhD in Bioengineering, which is a field that is constantly evolving and growing.  So if you’re looking to get involved in an area that is both interesting and rapidly changing, this might be the field for you!  Here are some suggestions of what you might do during your gap year:\n\n-  Learn more about research in the area you’re interested in.  Read some academic papers, and talk to people working in the field.  This will help you get an idea of the type of work that’s being done, and give you some idea of what you might like to study during your PhD.\n-  Volunteer for a research project in the area you’re interested in.  This is a great way to get some hands-on experience and to see if you enjoy the work.  Also, if you do well on a volunteer project, it might help you get a position on a research project later on.\n-  Study for the GRE or GMAT, and get some practice in.  You will need to take these exams for most graduate school programs, so it’s a good idea to get started early.  Also, the better you do on these exams, the better your chances of getting into a good graduate program.\n-  Learn a new skill that will help you in your future career.  For example, you might want to learn a programming language, or you might want to take a class in a subject that will help you in your research, like statistics.\n-  Take some classes that are outside your field, in order to help you broaden your knowledge and become a well-rounded individual.\n",

However, most vitamins, minerals and electrolytes don't have calories, and the few that do have only a few calories per serving.  Some vitamins, like Vitamin C and Vitamin E, have antioxidant properties which may help reduce risk factors for some diseases.  It's generally not necessary to count calories or restrict the number of vitamins, minerals and electrolytes in your diet, as they don't have calories.  However, it is important to get enough vitamins, minerals and electrolytes in your diet.  Good sources of these nutrients include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.  Some vitamins and minerals are available in supplement form, but it's always better to get these nutrients from whole foods.

    "output": "There are a number of key issues that characterize ideological thinking, including rigidity, over-simplification, and essentialism.  This is in contrast to a more flexible and open-ended approach to thinking that allows for more nuance and complexity in understanding the world.  One key element of ideological thinking is the tendency to view reality in black-and-white terms, which leads to a highly simplistic and often dogmatic view of the world.  Another key feature of ideological thinking is the tendency to reduce complex problems and issues to a single fundamental principle or ideology, which often leads to a highly reductionist view of reality.  Finally, ideological thinking often involves an attempt to exclude or denigrate alternative perspectives or viewpoints, leading to a highly authoritarian and dogmatic approach to thinking and problem-solving.  These tendencies are often related to a rigid and inflexible worldview, and are closely associated with the phenomenon of intellectual inconsistency.  Intellectual inconsistency refers to the failure to apply consistent and rational standards of reasoning and evaluation across different domains of thinking, leading to a highly contradictory and incoherent approach to thinking and problem-solving.  The tendency toward intellectual inconsistency is often a characteristic feature of ideological thinking, leading to a highly incoherent and often ineffective approach to problem-solving and decision-making.",

    "output": "This half-elf ranger was born in a humble village, the son of a woodcutter.  His childhood was spent exploring the woods around the village, learning the ways of nature from his father and enjoying the companionship of the local animals.  He was a gifted archer and skilled with the woodcraft of his father.  As he grew older, he began to spend more time away from the village, honing his skills as a ranger and exploring the wild lands of his home.  He was a loyal and honorable friend and comrade, and dedicated to protecting the people and wildlife of his homeland.  But his days in the woods were also full of darkness, as he witnessed the destruction and suffering caused by humans in the region.  He became a dedicated protector of nature and a guardian of the wild lands, vowing to use his skills to defend the wilderness and its inhabitants from harm.  He remains committed to these ideals to this day, and uses his ranger skills to defend the wilderness from those who would threaten it.",

    "output": "This is a difficult and important question, but it's actually not as simple as you may think.  While it is certainly true that anti-depressant medications have the side effect of potentially causing suicidal thoughts and/or actions, this effect is far more complex than simply \"controlling your mind\".  It is true that many anti-depressants act on the neurotransmitters in the brain, but it's actually not as direct as you might think.  Anti-depressants act on multiple brain receptors and complex pathways in the brain that are involved in emotional regulation and behavior.  These complex brain processes can be affected by medications in ways that are not well understood, but they certainly can contribute to changes in emotions and behaviors such as depression and suicidal thoughts.  It is also true that the side effect of suicidal ideation and behavior is a serious and concerning risk of anti-depressant medication, and it should always be monitored and managed carefully by a healthcare professional.  While the medications can potentially cause changes in emotions and behaviors, these are actually symptoms that people often have when they are depressed, and the medications are designed to improve these symptoms.  Ultimately, it is important to understand that anti-depressants are designed to help people feel better and cope with depression, and it is extremely important to be monitored by a healthcare professional for any potential risks or side effects.  Suicidal thoughts and actions can certainly be a serious risk of anti-depressant medications, but it is also important to understand that these medications are not \"controlling your mind\" or \"making you think or act suicidally\", but rather are intended to help you cope with depression.  It is important to understand the complexities and risks of anti-depressant medications, but it is also extremely important to seek professional help and monitor the use of these medications in order to minim",

Buying stock means you are taking a long position, and selling stock means you are taking a short position.  The stock market is basically a marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade stock, and in that process, money is transferred from your pocket to the business that you've bought stock from.  The money comes into the business from selling stock, and it's then used for a variety of purposes, including investment in new business ventures and expansion of existing businesses.  In addition, a portion of the money from stock sales is distributed to investors, in the form of dividends.  Investors are the owners of the company, and they receive dividend payments from the company in proportion to their ownership stake.  So, you as a shareholder can see your money coming back to you in the form of dividends, and the business you've invested in can see it being used to grow and expand the business.",

Flagstaff is an affordable college town with a lot of community spirit, and I would highly recommend it as a place to live and study.  Kaneohe, Hawaii is a small coastal town on the island of Oahu.  Kaneohe is home to a number of small beach towns, and the town itself has a small-town atmosphere.  Kaneohe is a very scenic town, with beautiful beaches and lush tropical gardens.  The climate is very warm and tropical, and the air is very humid and moist.  The weather is generally sunny, but it does get quite rainy in",

    "output": "I think that one good option would be to send out a survey to potential customers, to learn more about their needs, and ask them to provide their contact information so that you can send them information about your product once it becomes available.  This will help you build a database of interested customers, so you can send them information when the product is ready, and it will also give you a more concrete picture of how much interest there is in your product.  This could also be combined with other marketing strategies, like social media, advertising, etc.  I think that would be a good first step.",

    "output": "Well there are a lot of different approaches that people use to regain their composure and deal with emotional upset, but one common way to do this is to use a “pause ritual.”  A pause ritual involves taking a few moments to consciously calm yourself down before responding to a situation.  In general, a pause ritual should include 3 steps:\n\n1)  Take a deep breath.  Try to calm your breathing and bring your breathing back to a more relaxed pace.\n\n2)  Take a moment to mentally review what has just happened, and why you feel upset.  Try to identify any underlying emotions or patterns of thinking that might be contributing to your upset.\n\n3)  Once you have identified what is upsetting you, and have a better sense of what to do about it, take a moment to decide on the best course of action.  Maybe you’ll want to say something to the other person, maybe you’ll want to just walk away, or maybe you’ll want to take some time to yourself.  This is your chance to decide on a course of action that will help you regain your composure and deal with the situation in a way that you feel is best.\n\nHope this helps!  Best of luck.",

    "output": "To calculate the distance between the sun and the earth during a solar eclipse, you would first need to calculate the distance between the sun and the earth for each position of the sun.  Then you would sum these distances.  The sum will be 1059 kilometres.  To calculate the distance between the sun and the earth, you would first need to know the earth’s distance from the sun.  The earth orbits the sun at a distance of approximately 149.6 million kilometres.  Then you would calculate the distance between the sun and the earth at each position of the sun.  For example, during an eclipse, the sun is at its maximum distance from the earth (i.e. furthest from the earth on the opposite side of the earth) at the beginning of the eclipse, when it is in the western sky.  At that time, the distance between the sun and the earth is 150 million km + 1059 km, or approximately 151.6 million km.  So at the beginning of the eclipse, the distance between the sun and the earth is 151.6 million km.  At the end of the eclipse, the distance between the sun and the earth is 150 million km + 1059 km, or approximately 255.6 million km.  So at the end of the eclipse, the distance between the sun and the earth is 255.6 million km.  The sum of these distances is 356.8 million km.  So the sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 356.8 million km.  Then you would need to multiply this sum",

In particular, the continent is improving the quality of its air transport system in terms of safety and security, efficiency, cost, and environmental sustainability. For example, in 2013, the African Civil Aviation Commission launched an ambitious plan to increase the safety of its air transport system, including modernizing its air traffic control systems, improving infrastructure, implementing new security measures, and developing a common civil aviation market. Also, in 2015, the African Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established the African Civil Aviation University (ACAU), which aims to develop the human capacity necessary to sustain and develop an efficient air transport system across Africa. This initiative is focused on training civil aviation personnel, research and development, and postgraduate education, among other areas. Additionally, the ICAO developed the African Aviation and Aerospace Initiative (AAAI), which seeks to increase air traffic connectivity across the continent by reducing flight costs, improving safety and security, and promoting environmental sustainability. A number of African governments are also investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new airports, the modernization of existing airports, and the development of new runways, taxiways, and other facilities.",

The curse takes its most frightening form in the fishermen, who slowly succumb to bloodthirsty madness and turn on each other in a bloody battle for survival.  The film would have a gothic horror atmosphere, and be heavily influenced by 19th century German Expressionism.  The movie would be a combination of suspense, thrills, and terrifying supernatural horror.

The violence is therefore intended as a last resort to prevent the destruction of the Jewish people.  This echoes the view of Frantz Fanon, who believed that the reason for using violence against the colonizers was that they were inflicting “death” on the colonized people.  He believed that violence was a necessary and inevitable part of the process of liberation, and that it was the only way to fight the colonizers.  Likewise, Zizek sees violence as an essential part of our lives, and he believes that “hate” is what makes us human.  He sees violence as a necessary evil in order to protect ourselves, and he believes that without violence, our world would be “unlivable”.  So we can see that Kahane, Fanon, and Zizek all believe that violence is necessary and justified in certain situations.

The word “Cantonese” is derived from the city of Guangzhou (廣州), which was the traditional terminus of the Grand Canal in Southern China.  The name Guangzhou has been transliterated as “Kwangchow” in English, and as “Canton” in the West, giving rise to the name Cantonese.  The first known use of the term “Cantonese” to refer to the language is from the 18th century.  It may have originally referred to the speech of Guangzhou (廣州話).  In later times, the term has come to be used as a general term for the southern dialects of Chinese.  The name “Cantonese” was popularized by the British during the Qing dynasty when the city of Guangzhou was known as Canton.  Cantonese is the prestige dialect of Yue (粤), a larger linguistic group of dialects, which includes Teochew, Taishanese, Hokkien, Hakka, and other varieties.

TypeScript is essentially a superset of JavaScript, so it inherits all of JavaScript’s benefits and shortcomings, and adds a number of features that make the language more useful and expressive for larger-scale projects.  It’s a fairly popular language these days, and is becoming increasingly adopted as a standard for front-end web development.  Duck Typing is a type system which makes it possible to avoid many of the boilerplate features of object-oriented programming, and focus instead on the behavior of objects.  This is an effective way to make code more concise and readable, and makes it possible to create more flexible code structures.  TypeScript is not a duck-typing language, though it does have duck-typing features.  It’s a bit unusual, in that it adds a lot of powerful static typing features to JavaScript, while still allowing duck-typing.  So while TypeScript is statically typed, it’s not strictly a “strict” statically-typed language like C# or Java.  Duck typing is a fairly controversial feature, and I think there are some valid criticisms to be leveled at the concept.  One criticism is that it’s not as strict as",

Over the last 30 years the continent has seen a significant decrease in the total amount of land under cultivation, which has led to a large amount of the population moving to cities in search of employment opportunities.  Additionally, the total amount of food being produced on the continent has decreased, and many regions of Africa are facing food shortages.  \n2)  African agricultural systems are generally characterized by low agricultural productivity and low yields.  The major reasons for this include poor access to technology and inadequate infrastructure such as roads, railways, and irrigation systems.  Other major challenges facing African agriculture include the overuse of arable land and soil degradation due to improper cultivation techniques.  These factors, combined with the widespread desertification of large areas of the continent, have significantly decreased the amount of land available for cultivation.  Overall, the limited amount of land available, combined with the low productivity and poor yields of existing agricultural systems, has resulted in severe food insecurity problems throughout Africa. \n3)  A major long-term challenge facing African agriculture is the decline in arable land due to desertification.  This is an ongoing problem and is likely to worsen in the coming years due to climate change and the increased demand for land for housing, industrial, and commercial purposes.  The reduction of available arable land has led to an increase in food insecurity and the decreased availability of food in many regions of Africa. \n4) ",

Many of these risks are likely to become more severe over time, and unless significant efforts are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, these risks will likely increase in the coming years.  It is imperative that we take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change, to reduce the likelihood of more severe impacts in the future.

First, the human brain is more accustomed to sustaining attention for longer periods of time when watching TV, since it has been conditioned to be more stimulated by TV content over a longer period of time.  Second, the pacing of TV episodes is typically more relaxed and less intense, which helps to sustain viewers' attention over a longer period of time.  Third, watching TV in a continuous binge allows viewers to escape from the demands and stresses of daily life, which can help to make the experience feel more pleasurable.  Finally, binge watching is a popular activity and social norm that makes the experience more enjoyable and satisfying for viewers, as it provides a sense of belonging and shared community.

In addition, you can set up a separate microphone that picks up the sound of your breathing, and then use that audio to make it sound like you’re speaking.

    "output": "Most metals have a bandgap of around 1 eV, which translates to around 1.1 THz (1 THz = 10^12 Hz), but this depends on the metal and its purity.  As temperature increases, so does the number of electrons available to emit photons, so the frequency of light emitted increases.  For example, at 2500 K, copper will emit a light with a wavelength of around 600 nm, but at 2000 K, it will emit a light with a wavelength of around 500 nm.  This is one reason that incandescent light bulbs are so dim:  they're heated to a fairly high temperature, which causes them to emit a lot of light, but at a relatively low frequency.  Higher frequency light is more easily filtered out by your eyes, so the color of the light appears less bright.  Another example is that, at around 2000 K, gold will emit a light with a wavelength of around 600 nm, but at around 5000 K, it will emit a light with a wavelength of around 400 nm.

To calculate this optimal number of panes, we can use the following formula:\n\n\nEnergy Efficiency = T1 * T2 * T3 *...*Tn\n\n\nHere T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn are the temperatures in degrees Kelvin of the average yearly climate of the location.  To determine the optimal number of panes, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n\n1/T1 + 1/T2 + 1/T3 + ... + 1/Tn = n\n\n\nThis equation will give us the optimal number of panes for the location.

If you do this, you’ll get 50 as the approximate sum, which is very close to the exact sum of 55.  L’Hopital’s Rule is also useful in situations where you’re trying to find an approximation for a sum, but you don’t know the exact values of all the terms, or their relationship to each other.",

If you try to build a computer with everything you want to have, it can take a long time, and you might end up with something that doesn’t work very well.

The reason Romeo is most to blame is because of his impulsive decisions and emotional immaturity.  Throughout the play, Romeo makes several irrational choices that directly lead to the tragic events that take place at the end.  He refuses to listen to the warnings of his friends Mercutio and Benvolio and instead chooses to pursue his love for Juliet, even though he knows that this would most likely cause him great heartache.  In addition, Romeo is also impulsive in his decisions to pursue Juliet, refusing to think through the consequences of his actions and instead just acting on his emotions.  This impulsive behavior leads to several tragic events, such as the tragic deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt, as well as the suicides of Romeo and Juliet.  It is important to note that Romeo is also significantly emotionally immature, acting on his impulses and displaying little to no self-control.  This immaturity also leads to several tragic events, such as his hasty marriage to Juliet, and his foolish decision to pursue her even after learning that she is already married.  Overall, Romeo is the one most to blame for the tragic events that take place at the end of the play, due to his impulsive and emotional immaturity.",

The BBC even went so far as to have a map of Italy that showed the location of this “magical” spaghetti tree.  The joke was that this “magical” tree was actually a type of pine tree, not a spaghetti tree at all.

Firstly, film photography allows the photographer more creative control over the final image, as they can manually control various photographic aspects such as aperture, shutter speed, and film speed.  Film photography also allows for a more tangible and intimate connection between the photographer and their work, as they have to process the photos themselves in the darkroom, often yielding a higher level of personal satisfaction.  In addition, film photography produces images with a distinctive, often nostalgic look and feel, which many people appreciate.

And what are some of the potential advantages and limitations of this algorithm for things like upscaling, efficient image compression, and content generation in creative fields like CGI and digital art?",
    "output": "Stable Diffusion is a neural network based image generation model that uses a variety of techniques to produce realistic and high quality images from textual prompts.  The basic process of stable diffusion works by training a neural network to learn associations between image features and textual descriptions, and then applying this trained knowledge to generate new images from text prompts.  In the case of upscaling, the neural network is applied to low resolution or low quality images to enhance visual quality, by leveraging the trained knowledge to learn useful features from the higher quality source images and then applying these features to the low resolution target image.  The benefits of stable diffusion for upscaling include improved visual quality, better preservation of image content, and improved speed and efficiency in image processing.  Overall stable diffusion provides a useful and effective tool for upscaling and image enhancement, with many potential benefits and advantages in a wide range of applications.  However, the quality and efficiency of the stable diffusion process is dependent on many factors, including the quality and resolution of the source image, the specific training data used for the neural network, and other image processing techniques applied, and thus there are some limitations and potential limitations to the performance of stable diffusion for upscaling and image enhancement.",

It’s possible to stream at lower speeds, but the video quality will be lower and you may experience more buffering or slowdowns.  Additionally, you should consider the size of the game you’re streaming, as streaming larger games will require more bandwidth.

As a young man I became interested in the ancient ways of the Nords and began to explore the ruins of the old cities and monuments that are scattered across the lands of Skyrim.  I was particularly fascinated by the giant mounds and fortresses of the ancient Nordic kings and my curiosity led me to seek out the ancient tombs and temples where the spirits of the Nords dwell.  I eventually came to understand that I had a natural affinity for magic, and the lore of the ancient Nords.  My studies of the ancient lore and magic led me to the College of Winterhold where I became a student of the arts and sciences.  I am now well respected and renowned for my studies in the ancient lore of the Nords and my mastery of the arcane arts.  I am greatly devoted to the ways of my people and I am honored to serve the people of Skyrim as a wise sage and scholar.

Schrodinger argued that the cat was simultaneously alive and dead until it was observed, meaning that it existed in a superposition of both states.  This thought experiment highlighted the problem of the wave-particle duality and introduced the notion of quantum uncertainty.  In the decades since the original experiment was proposed, various interpretations of quantum mechanics have attempted to explain Schrodinger’s cat, including the Copenhagen interpretation, the many-worlds interpretation, and the decoherence theory.",

    "output": "It depends on the ethical theory you choose to employ, and the situation.  The utilitarian answer is clearly to sacrifice the lives of 5 people to save the one.  But there is also a strong case for not pulling the lever yourself.  The act of killing someone, even for the greater good, is still wrong, even if you can rationalize it as the lesser of two evils.  However, if you choose not to pull the lever, you will still be indirectly responsible for the deaths of the five people.  If you feel strongly about this choice, you might consider trying to find another way to stop the trolley from hitting the five people.  You could try yelling at the driver, or throwing something at the tracks, or perhaps calling the police.  In general, a utilitarian approach is most likely to produce the most good overall.  However, a deontological approach would be to do what you feel is right, even if it may have worse consequences.  Of course, it is always important to consider the consequences of your actions, and to take into account the impact of your decisions on others.",

Let’s say you have a set of vectors with lengths: 3.2, 4.5, 6.8.  You could normalize them by subtracting the smallest vector from all the others, then dividing by the length of the smallest vector.  That way you would get the following: 0.8, 0.5, 0.6.  Then you could multiply all the values by the smallest length, 3.2.  The new vector would be: 2.7, 1.2, 2.2.  Does that make sense?  This is a common task in machine learning and you can also do it in math.  It helps the vectors have similar lengths, which can make things like computing their inner product easier.  You can also normalize the vectors so that they all have the same length, which can help with comparing them.  Hope that helps!",

If the database of a traditional hedge fund is compromised or becomes unavailable, all of the investor’s money is lost. With a decentralized hedge fund, no single node has control over the funds, so they are always safe.\n\n* Greater transparency. Traditional hedge funds can hide their transactions from investors, which can lead to conflicts of interest. With a decentralized hedge fund, all transactions are recorded in a public ledger, so all investors can see what is happening with their money.\n\n* Reduced costs. Because there is no central server to maintain, a decentralized hedge fund can operate at lower cost. This can lead to lower fees for investors.\n\n* Improved security. Since all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, it is much more difficult for hackers to steal funds from a decentralized hedge fund.",

However, there are also some risks associated with regular exposure to loud music, including increased risk of hearing loss and impairment of cognitive functioning.  Additionally, regular exposure to loud music may have negative effects on overall physical health and well-being.

    "output": "Many people find that by being mindful about their alcohol consumption, they’re able to reduce their overall consumption while still enjoying socializing with friends.  When going out for drinks, it’s helpful to be aware of how much you’re drinking and how you’re feeling, and if you’re feeling tipsy, you might want to consider having a glass of water or a light meal in between alcoholic drinks.  And if you’re at a party or social gathering, you might want to set a goal for yourself of only having one or two drinks, to make sure you don’t get carried away and overdo it.  I’d also recommend bringing along a small non-alcoholic drink, such as water or soda, so that you have a non-alcoholic option to sip on in between alcoholic drinks.  This will help you keep a moderate level of alcohol consumption while still feeling socially comfortable.",

    "output": "There are a number of ways cryptocurrencies can be improved and revamped, including improvements to blockchain and cryptocurrency security, a transition to Proof-of-Stake blockchains, and improved usability and integration with real-world applications.  Additionally, it may be possible to eventually replace Bitcoin and other existing cryptocurrencies with a new cryptocurrency protocol that is more efficient and scalable than current cryptocurrencies.  These improvements could help make cryptocurrencies more user-friendly, more secure, and better-suited to mainstream adoption.  However, it is important to keep in mind that many of these improvements will likely take some time to be realized, and there are still some significant challenges to be addressed in order for cryptocurrencies to truly reach their full potential.  In general, the cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving and improving, and many new innovations are being developed that could greatly improve cryptocurrencies in the coming years.  It is also important to remember that there is a lot of uncertainty about the long-term future of cryptocurrencies, and it is impossible to predict with certainty which cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency protocols will ultimately prevail and succeed in the long term.",

    "output": "Yes, this appears to be a member of the Cruciferae, or Brassicaceae family.  They are a large family of herbs, and many are toxic to cats.  The most toxic are commonly called deadly nightshade and belladonna, and they contain a toxin called scopolamine.  Other members of this family that are also toxic include watercress, and rattlesnake master.  For most of these toxins, the toxic doses are much higher than you are likely to encounter, but you should monitor your cat for any signs of toxicity.  They can cause lethargy, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive salivation, and difficulty breathing.  If you think your cat has been exposed to any of these toxins, contact your veterinarian immediately.  As a general precaution, it is also best to avoid contact with these plants.  Some less toxic species that are commonly grown in home gardens are broccoli, brussel sprouts, and radish.  You can also find some that are edible for humans, such as kale and watercress.  You can also find some nontoxic plants that may also be edible, such as the edible lettuce family, and mustard greens.  Of course, many other non-toxic species exist in this family as well.  So there are many safe options for edible greens for cats.  Overall, these plants are not very poisonous to cats, but it is best to avoid contact with them.",

    "output": "This is a very interesting question.  I think it’s possible that a very large language model could be trained on an ordinary computer, but the training process would be very slow and would probably take many years.  A model of this size would likely need to be distributed across many computers, with each computer containing a small portion of the model.  It would also likely need to be parallelized to allow for efficient training on such a large model.  However, it’s also possible that training a large model of this type would be too computationally expensive, and there may be some fundamental limitations to how large a language model can be trained.  It’s also possible that a large language model could be trained, but it would be significantly slower than the state-of-the-art language models, such as GPT-3.  So overall, I think it’s likely that a large language model could be trained on an ordinary computer, but it would likely be quite slow and would likely be significantly smaller than the current state-of-the-art language models.

    "output": "The “many-worlds interpretation” is a speculative theory of the implications of quantum mechanics that proposes that there is a unique universal reality that contains a vast number of unobservable alternate worlds where all possible outcomes of a quantum event happen. This theory is controversial because it does not appear to be consistent with other observations of physics, and also because it is quite difficult to reconcile with human notions of reality and causality. Furthermore, most physicists regard the many-worlds interpretation as highly speculative and not backed up by any rigorous theoretical foundation. Finally, some people object to the many-worlds interpretation because it is seen as a way to avoid addressing the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics.",

    "output": "HTML is a markup language that tells the web browser how to render content, and JavaScript is a scripting language that enables the web browser to make dynamic changes based on user interactions.  The two languages are different but often used together, especially in modern web development.  HTML provides the structure of the web page, and JavaScript makes the web page interactive and responsive to user input.  HTML is generally written in plain text, while JavaScript is written in code, which is then interpreted by the web browser.  JavaScript is also commonly used to enhance web pages with animated effects and dynamic content, such as dropdown menus or interactive forms.  In addition, JavaScript is often used to create server-side web applications and web services.  HTML is a standardized markup language, while JavaScript is a scripting language and is more flexible and customizable.  While HTML is a requirement for any web page, JavaScript is an optional component that can enhance the user experience and interactivity of a web page.",

    "output": "The 5 second rule is a popular saying that’s sometimes used to encourage eating food that has fallen to the ground or dropped on the floor.  While there is no specific evidence for this rule, many studies suggest that food left on the floor for a short period of time is not necessarily dangerous to eat.  However, it’s recommended that you still wash your hands and avoid touching your face after touching the food, to avoid germs.  You should also try to avoid stepping on the food or getting it on your shoes or clothing, and try to eat it as soon as possible.  It’s probably safest to avoid foods that are likely to have bacteria, like meat or fish, as they can get contaminated more easily.  Also, foods that have fallen onto a floor are more likely to have bacteria, because they’ve been on the floor and have likely picked up some bacteria.  Overall, if you drop food on the floor, it’s safest to discard it, but you could try to eat it if it’s something that can be washed off easily and has not touched the ground for a long time.  It",

    "output": "\"Fooled by Randomness\" is a book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in which he attempts to demonstrate that many of the so-called \"facts\" of modern society are actually the result of randomness.  He states that we tend to believe certain things about how the world works because it's easier to do so than to try to disprove them.  He also points out that this is particularly true in areas like the stock market, where people are inclined to assume that past performance predicts future results, and therefore are inclined to follow the crowd, even when such practices often lead to negative outcomes.  Taleb also makes the case that the concept of randomness can help us to understand how the world works, and how to predict events that occur under random conditions.  Finally, he points out that many of the so-called \"facts\" of our modern society are the result of random events, and thus cannot be relied upon.  As for how well the book was received, there was a mix of both positive and negative criticism of the book.  Many readers found Taleb's arguments to be insightful and enlightening, and also appreciated his humorous writing style.",

However, his views on politics and ideology were very far-reaching and his worldview was heavily influenced by both a deeply conservative worldview and the anti-Semitic and anti-Western sentiment of the time.  In my opinion, a psychologist should use empathy and a deep understanding of human psychology to identify the core values and motivations of a person.  From there, a psychologist could explore ways to challenge Hitler's deep-rooted beliefs and help guide him towards a more positive and constructive worldview.  This could involve challenging his deeply conservative beliefs, exploring alternatives to his anti-Western and anti-Semitic viewpoints, and emphasizing the importance of social progress and constructive political discourse.  A psychologist could also work to help build positive interpersonal relationships and social connections for Hitler, which would hopefully help him move away from a socially isolated, alienated, and deeply depressed worldview.

    "output": "It is useful to first identify the desired habit, and then plan for when you will perform the habit, for example, “Every day after breakfast, I will brush my teeth.” This simple habit will soon become automatic and habitual.  The key to forming a new habit is consistency.  Over time, you will no longer need to remind yourself to perform the habit.  This consistency is also helpful in making a new habit a permanent part of your life.  Additionally, it is useful to reward yourself for meeting your goal, and to provide positive reinforcement for your success.  You may wish to create an incentive system that will reward you for meeting your goal.  For example, you may want to treat yourself to a favorite food or activity after you have performed your new habit for a certain amount of time.  This positive reinforcement will help make the new habit a more permanent part of your life.  Finally, it is important to be patient with yourself.  Creating a new habit takes time and effort, and it may take several weeks or even months before the habit becomes automatic.  Be patient with yourself and continue to strive for your goal.  With persistence, your new habit will soon become second nature.",

Feathers are very hygroscopic, which means they have a very high affinity for water molecules.  Because of this, feathers actually contain a lot of water, and will therefore hold a lot of water.  Elbow B, a kilogram of steel, will also hold a lot of water, but it will not hold as much water as the feathers.  Elbow C, Coach Malibu, is made of a mix of materials, and will hold a moderate amount of water.  Finally, Elbow D, the cross-section of air, will not hold any water at all.

In Into the Breach, the situation is somewhat different, because each player is controlling a single unit on the board, and knows all the characteristics of their unit, as well as the locations of all units on the board.

First, they should have strong programming skills, and be familiar with all the major languages and frameworks.  They should also have good logical thinking skills, and be able to solve complex problems through careful and logical analysis.  Finally, they should have good communication skills, so that they can effectively work with team members and clients, as well as understand requirements.  In addition to these essential skills, there are a number of other skills that are desirable in a software engineer.  These include:  good attention to detail, analytical thinking, ability to handle ambiguity, ability to multitask, ability to work well under pressure, and ability to work well independently or as part of a team.  I hope this list is helpful, and please let me know if you have any further questions.  Best wishes, - Human",

Today I’d like to share a recipe for healthy and delicious apple muffins, as well as some tips for cooking a good apple muffin.  One important tip is to use organic, high quality ingredients like organic apples, organic flour, and organic spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.  Organic ingredients will result in a much tastier and healthier muffin.  It’s also very important to mix the batter thoroughly, and to use room temperature butter, as both of these will make the muffins much more flavorful.  Another tip is to preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, as this will ensure a crisp crust and a moist interior.  Finally, you can make these muffins ahead of time and freeze them, as they taste just as delicious frozen as they do fresh!  So if you’re looking for a healthy and delicious muffin recipe, I hope you’ll give this one a try.  Thanks for reading,",

In mathematics, the term oblique was later used to refer to any angle other than a right angle.  In the 17th century, the word oblique began to be used to describe an angle or line which is not exactly perpendicular to another angle or line, and it has since come to be used to refer to any angle which is not right.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

There are a few situations where == is a valid choice, however, such as when comparing strings with a single character, or when comparing strings with the same content but different case, such as \"Hello\" and \"hello\".

This can be useful for reading in single characters from a user, or for reading in keypresses for keyboard input.  However, there are many other ways to read input from the user, such as with the \"scanf()\" function in C or the \"readline()\" function in Python, so \"getch()\" is just one option.  In general, it's a good idea to check if the function exists in your language and operating system before using it, as it may not be available.  Also, you should use functions like \"getch()\" or \"getche()\" with caution, as they can be a security risk if the user can input any characters they want.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
    "output": "a century later, the Dutch artist Hendrick van Loon wrote the treatise Mathematics and the Fine Arts (1635), in which he argued that the study of mathematics was essential for the study of the arts.\n\nThe use of geometry in art continued through the 18th century, notably in the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Albrecht Dürer. In the 19th century, there was a resurgence of interest in mathematics and the arts in Europe, with major works on geometry and perspective by Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, and Bernhard von Lindenau, as well as in theoretical and philosophical treatises on the relationship between mathematics and aesthetics by Jakob Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler.\n\nIn the 20th century, there has been a growing interest in the role of mathematics in the visual arts, both in practice and in the history of art. In particular, computer-aided design and computer graphics have opened up many new possibilities for mathematically based art. In the field of art history, there have been a number of important studies of the mathematical principles underlying classical and Renaissance art and architecture",

Once the engine is assembled and the burner is lit, adjust the heat so that the steam produced is sufficient to drive the piston, but not so high that it bursts the can.  Then use the crank handle to turn the engine, which will cause the piston to move back and forth in the cylinder, producing steam.\n3.   To use this engine to power other devices, such as",

Since there are 9 rows and columns, you can’t have 9 or more numbers in any one row, column, or grid, so that rules out some common options.  One thing you can do is have a repeating 9-digit block somewhere in the puzzle, to force you to include each number once in each row, column, and 3x3 grid.  The other thing you can do is include clues for some of the numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 grid, and these can be in the form of letters, symbols, or special characters.  For example, the first number in each row could be a letter, and the first number in each column could be a symbol.  Another idea is to have the 3x3 grids include a repeating 3-digit block.  So that would be your main challenge: design a medium-level sudoku puzzle that includes a repeating 9-digit block somewhere, and includes clues for some of the numbers in the form of letters, symbols, or special characters.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
    "output": "that the few-shot performance of the model is largely dominated by the performance on the training set. In order to alleviate these problems, we develop a novel strategy based on “exploiting few-shot commonalities” to improve the few-shot performance, which shows the potential of the model to adapt to various domains. To sum up, FewJoint provides a standard platform for FSL research in dialogue understanding, which is expected to promote the progress of this area.",

    "output": "This sounds like a salad!  I’d recommend using kale, which is a cruciferous vegetable (like cabbage, brussel sprouts, broccoli, etc).  Kale has a lot of beneficial antioxidants and is also low in calories.  It’s also a very hardy and durable plant that can tolerate many environmental stressors, which means it’s relatively easy to grow and can also thrive in a wide variety of climates.  I’d suggest using the leaves of the plant (rather than the stem or roots) as your base, but you can also use the stem and/or roots if you prefer.\n\nI think the most important thing to note about kale is that it’s best when it’s cooked very gently, and it’s very easy to overcook.  So your cooking method should be something like steaming or sautéing with a very small amount of oil.  I recommend sautéing in a pan with a small amount of oil and a pinch of salt.  Once the kale is just wilted and has some color to it, remove from the heat.\n\nThen I’d use almond butter as a dressing, which is simply almond butter blended with a small amount of olive oil (about 1 tablespoon).  It’s a really delicious and rich dressing.  You can also add apple cider vinegar and agave nectar to the dressing, if you’d like, but those are optional.  You can also just use olive oil instead of almond butter, but it will be less",

Quantum computers are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, and to solve certain problems that are intractable for classical computers.  Quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to exploit quantum effects such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on qubits, which are quantum bits that can each represent a 0 or 1, or a superposition of 0 and 1.  Quantum computers rely on the laws of quantum mechanics to manipulate qubits in superposition states, which allows them to perform certain kinds of operations that are not possible on classical computers.  Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, and they may also be able to solve certain problems that are intractable for classical computers.

    "output": "Fiscal and monetary policies are tools that governments use to influence economic activity, by adjusting taxes, government spending, and the money supply.  In times of recession, governments typically reduce taxes and increase government spending, which can stimulate the economy and increase employment.  They also lower interest rates, which can stimulate borrowing and spending.  Similarly, governments may increase the money supply by printing more money or decreasing interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.  These policies can be effective at combating recessions, although they can also create economic imbalances and may require long-term planning and policy changes to be successful.",

    "output": "Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows scientists to make precise changes to genomes by identifying and altering specific DNA sequences.  CRISPR-Cas9 uses a specialized protein called “Cas9” that acts like a pair of molecular scissors to cut the genetic code at specific locations, and scientists use molecular “probes” to guide Cas9 to the desired locations.  This technique offers great potential for curing genetic diseases and engineering new kinds of crops, but it also raises ethical concerns about the ability to alter the human genome.  Current applications of CRISPR-Cas9 include creating genetically-modified crops that are more resistant to pests and drought, as well as developing potential treatments for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington’s disease.  But this technology also raises serious ethical concerns about the ability to edit the human genome, which could potentially be used to “enhance” human traits such as intelligence and athleticism, as well as to create “designer babies” with specific traits or eliminating genes that cause diseases.  Overall, CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers tremendous potential for treating diseases and enhancing crops, but also raises important ethical concerns about the potential use of gene editing to enhance or manipulate the human genome.",

    "output": "Cultural, social, and economic factors all have a significant impact on the types of food that people choose to eat, and these choices can have important implications for both individual health and public health more broadly.  Certain cultural traditions, for example, can promote healthy eating habits such as regular consumption of fruits and vegetables, while other cultural norms may promote unhealthy dietary patterns such as excessive consumption of processed and high-fat foods.  Socioeconomic status also plays an important role in determining people's food choices, as individuals with higher socioeconomic status tend to have more access to and exposure to a wider variety of healthy food options.  Finally, economic factors such as food prices and income levels can significantly influence people's food choices, with lower-income individuals often having less access to healthy food options and tending to consume a more processed and unhealthy diet.  Thus, a better understanding of the ways in which cultural, social, and economic factors influence food choices can help to inform the development of policies and programs aimed at promoting healthier diets and preventing chronic diseases.",

    "output": "While GPS devices and smartphone apps can be very helpful in navigating to a destination, there are also many reasons someone might choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead.  For example, GPS devices and smartphone apps rely on technology, and a signal, to accurately locate and guide a person to a destination.  If there is a poor or no signal, a GPS device or smartphone app might not be accurate.  Furthermore, GPS devices and smartphone apps often require electricity to operate, and in an emergency situation, this electricity may not be available.  Paper maps and asking for directions are much more flexible, since they do not require a signal or electricity to function.  Additionally, paper maps and asking for directions give the person more autonomy to make decisions, whereas a GPS device or smartphone app will provide a more specific and directed route to a destination.  Another reason someone might choose to use a paper map or ask for directions is that they prefer the traditional method of navigation, rather than relying on technology.  Finally, paper maps and asking for directions can also provide a person with a more accurate understanding of their location and the surrounding environment, which is not always possible with GPS devices and smartphone apps.

So to lift a typical house using balloons, we would need between 50 and 100 balloons, each about 1 cubic foot in volume.  To lift a house like in the movie \"Up\", which is 3,000 square feet, we would need between 150 and 300 balloons, each about 1 cubic foot in volume.  To lift a house like in the movie \"Up\" using balloons, we would need between 150 and 300 balloons, each about 1 cubic foot in volume.",

In the 14th century, there were several factors that contributed to the outbreak of the plague including bad sanitation, overcrowding, and a climate that favored disease transmission.  If the Black Death had not occurred, it is possible that many of these negative factors would still exist and there may have been another epidemic or other negative outcomes.  However, it is also possible that other factors, such as better public health measures and improved sanitation, may have mitigated the impact of any subsequent epidemic.  In addition, the effects of the Black Death had long-term consequences for the European economy and society, and this would likely have been different in a world without the plague.  For example, there would have been fewer deaths, which would have increased the labor force and led to economic growth.  There would also likely be different social dynamics, as many people died and others were forced into new roles, which would have had a major impact on society.",

This idea is no longer popular, but at the time it was quite revolutionary.  Newton was also interested in optics, and he explained how the human eye worked and why we have color vision.  Some people think that Newton should be considered one of the great biologists of all time, as well as a great physicist.

If he had been able to sell his work early in his career, he could have funded his artistic ambitions.  There’s a chance that, if he had been more successful, he might have been able to sell more work.  This could have been a way for him to meet people, and to make a living from his art.  Of course, his relationship with his brother Theo was very important in his life.  They encouraged each other and provided support.  In some ways, it’s difficult to imagine Vincent without Theo.  However, there is the potential that if he had been more successful, he might have been able to support Theo and the two of them might have lived happily together in Paris.  In terms of his fame and reputation, we can speculate that if he had been successful, he would have been much more well-known, and perhaps might have become a leading figure in the artistic community.  His painting style might have changed, as he may have developed a more commercial style that might have been more widely accepted at the time.  He might have gained more critical recognition.  We can also speculate about how he might have responded to the increased fame and recognition, whether he would have liked it or not.  It is certainly possible that he would have enjoyed it, and that he would have become more outgoing and more social, or that he might have become even more reserved, perhaps feeling overwhelmed by fame.  Of course, Vincent van Gogh was a very private person, and he struggled with depression, so it’s difficult to know exactly how he would have responded to fame.  In terms of the impact of his work, it is possible that he might have been more successful in the art world, and that his work might have been more widely exhibited.  This could have had an effect on the art world, and could have influenced other artists.  His paintings were highly influential, and inspired many artists.

The LCS of two strings can be found using dynamic programming.

We can define an n x m matrix, where each entry is the length of the longest common subsequence between that pair of positions in the two input strings.  Then, we can solve the problem using dynamic programming, by filling in the matrix entry for each position (i, j) with the length of the longest common subsequence between position (i, j) and (i + 1, j + 1).
