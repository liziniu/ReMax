    "output": "The official names of the US states were generally chosen by the original colonial settlers and based on either geographical or historical factors.  Some of the most common state names are derived from the Native American tribes that originally inhabited the area, such as Massachusetts, New York, and South Carolina.  Other states were named after people or places that held historical importance, such as Pennsylvania and Virginia.  And some states were named after US states that had played an important role in the American Revolution, such as New Jersey and Delaware.",

    "instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
    "output": "Kickball is a game where teams of 4-8 players kick a large ball across a field and try to get it into a goal.  There are usually 2 goals on opposite sides of the field, and the team with the most goals wins.  Each player has to kick the ball at least once during the game, and the kicker must not move while kicking.  If the kicker moves, it's a foul.  The game also includes a series of outs, which are penalties that players can incur for violations like kicking the ball out of the field of play or dropping it while running.  It's important to remember that kickball is a non-contact game, so players can't tackle or hit each other.  Here are a few more kickball rules:\n\n-Each team has 5 innings to score a goal.\n-The ball must be kicked over the goal line to score a goal.\n-Kickers can't advance past the neutral zone while kicking the ball.\n-Kickers can't push or tackle opposing players.\n-The kicker has 5 seconds to kick the ball after it has been legally kicked into the field.\n-There is no limit to the number of times a team can kick the ball in a single play.\n-Players must wait in the neutral zone until the ball has been kicked into the field of play.",

Each team tries to score points by serving and then hitting the shuttlecock over the net so that it lands inside the opposing team’s half of the court.  You can hit the shuttlecock either on the fly (while it’s in the air), or by hitting it before it bounces on the ground.  You win a point by hitting the shuttlecock and causing it to land inside your opponent’s half of the court, or by preventing your opponent from doing the same.

This magma can either rise through existing cracks in the crust, or it can force its way up through newly formed fissures.  As the magma rises, it builds up pressure, and when it reaches the surface, it can burst out through the opening in the form of lava or volcanic gas.  Over time, this process can build up the ground above the vent, forming a volcano.  The magma itself is heated by the Earth’s internal heat, and as it rises it expands and becomes more viscous, which helps it push its way up through the crust.  The exact mechanism for how the magma is heated is still being studied, but it is thought to involve radioactive decay and the Earth’s own heat source.",

    "output": "The first hints that the earth was spherical came from ancient Greek and Egyptian cultures, who had developed sophisticated astronomy.  They knew that the stars were much farther away than they appeared, and the shape of the shadow of the earth on the moon suggested that the earth was round.  However, most people believed that the earth was flat, because it looked flat to the naked eye.  The reason people believed the earth was flat was because they could not conceive of the earth being anything other than what they saw, and because early maps did not accurately depict the curvature of the earth.  It was not until the Renaissance that European scientists began to explore the possibility that the earth was round, and this was mainly due to the work of scholars like Ptolemy, who used astronomical observations to construct a model of the universe that suggested the earth was round.",

Early humans likely had many questions about the world around them, and a belief in a divine creator or powerful force provided a helpful way to make sense of things.  Belief in God may also have helped early humans to cope with difficult circumstances or provide a sense of comfort and security.  Over time, these beliefs about God likely became more rigid and entrenched, and religions began to emerge.",

By the 1920s, aircraft designers had developed a variety of different types of aircraft, including biplanes, monoplanes, and seaplanes.

In order to become a CPA, you need to complete a bachelor’s degree in accounting or a related field, and then pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (the CPA exam).  After you pass the CPA exam, you’ll need to complete a number of hours of supervised work experience under the guidance of a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or a Certified Public Accounting firm (CPA firm).

These cats had lived in this building for many generations, and had gained a reputation for being quite cantankerous and unfriendly to outsiders.  However, they were also well-known for their unique and often bizarre habits and behaviors, which were the subject of much gossip and speculation among the human residents of the building.  Here is one anecdote about the cats from this legendary high-rise co-op:\n\nIt was well-known among the residents of the building that the cats always seemed to have a supply of perfectly preserved cans of cat food in their larder, even though it was many years since any human had last seen these cats eat.  One day, a resident who had taken a fancy to one of the cats approached the cat’s den and noticed that the cans of cat food appeared to have been recently opened.  He decided to investigate further and entered the cat’s den, where he found a large bowl of food sitting on the floor.  In the middle of the bowl was a small black object, which upon closer inspection turned out to be the freshly severed head of one of the resident cats.  The human resident fled the den in terror and quickly reported the disturbing discovery to the management of the building.",

This led to a number of problems, as the Indigenous Australians did not have the knowledge or technologies to deal with the newcomers.  There were several conflicts and conflicts, and ultimately the Indigenous Australians were subjugated and their land taken over by the British.  So in a sense they were prisoners of the English.

    "output": "To cook a juicy, medium-rare steak, you will want to season it well with salt and pepper, and then cook it to a medium-rare doneness.  For a 1-inch thick steak, you will want to cook it for 4-6 minutes per side on a hot grill or in a hot skillet.  You will want to make sure it is cooked on the rare side of medium-rare, but you also want to make sure it is cooked to a good internal temperature of at least 130°F.  To test for doneness, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak.  Make sure you cook it until it reaches the desired doneness before removing it from the heat.  Once it has reached the desired doneness, you will want to let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.  During the resting period, the juices will redistribute throughout the steak, which will result in a juicier steak.",

Women make up nearly 50% of the world’s population, yet only 7% of directors of top-grossing films are women.  This gender imbalance in the film industry has long been a source of controversy, with some arguing that this is simply a matter of free choice, while others argue that it’s a result of sexism and discrimination against female filmmakers.  Do you believe that this imbalance is a matter of free choice, or do you think there is also an element of discrimination involved?  And what can be done to address this imbalance?\n\nFilm Director:  I definitely believe there is an element of discrimination involved in the low number of female film directors.  The film industry has a long history of sexism and discrimination against female filmmakers, which has resulted in a lack of opportunity and support for female directors.  In addition, there are often biases against female-led films, which can make it more difficult for female filmmakers to get their work seen and financially supported.  As for what can be done to address this imbalance, I think more effort needs to be made to support and promote female filmmakers, and to address any discrimination they face.  In addition, more female film directors need to be given the opportunity to make films, and the industry needs to recognize the value of female perspectives in filmmaking.",

    "output": "That’s an interesting question!  The “official” answer to your question is that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats contain calories because those are the only nutrients that can be directly oxidized by the body to produce energy.  The calories in proteins, carbs and fats are known as “calories from fat” or “calories from carbohydrates” or “calories from protein”.  The calories in vitamins, minerals and other electrolytes are called “micronutrients” and they have no direct caloric value because they are not metabolized for energy.  So to answer your question, it is a convention of nutrition science that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats have calories because they are the only nutrients that can directly be oxidized for energy.",

Here is an example of a Braille sentence:\n\nil9op op\n\nTranslating this sentence into English, it says “IL9OP is happy”.  Braille words are made up of 3-5 “cells”, each cell representing a different letter or symbol.  These cells are arranged in a rectangular grid, with the top line representing the first letter of the word, and each subsequent line representing the next letter in order.  The cell on the far left is the “start” cell, and the cell on the far right is the “end” cell.  The cell in between these two is the “current” cell, and represents the current letter or symbol.\n\nI hope this provides some ideas for you!

Innovation encourages competition, creates new industries, and produces new products and services that improve our lives.  The benefits of innovation are far-reaching and include new jobs, higher incomes, and better quality of life for all Australians.  Innovation also increases productivity, reduces costs, and makes our economy more competitive in the global marketplace.  \n\n2)  Innovation also plays a critical role in tackling many of society’s biggest challenges.  For example, it is helping us to combat climate change by developing more sustainable and efficient energy sources.  Innovation is also crucial for addressing health and social challenges such as mental illness and ageing.  And innovation is essential for driving improvements in education and training.  These benefits are not just theoretical -- they can be seen in everyday life, such as through technological advancements in areas like mobile phones and the internet.  \n\n3)  Innovation is also a major driver of the knowledge economy.  It enables the discovery and creation of new knowledge, which in turn drives economic growth and productivity.  Innovation is also key to increasing Australia’s global competitiveness, as it allows us to remain at the forefront of technology and produce new products and services that are in demand on the world stage.  It is also essential for building Australia’s research capacity and ensuring we continue to attract the brightest minds from around the world.  The knowledge economy is a major source of new jobs, higher incomes, and improved standards of living.\n\n4)  Innovation is also crucial for building a more diverse, resilient, and inclusive economy.

Anakin tried to politely object to the old Jedi’s advice, but the spirit only grew more agitated and rude, and finally Anakin was so offended that he left the council chamber in a huff.

    "output": "Warmth can cause you to feel tired for a few different reasons.  First, warmth can make you feel sleepy because it activates your body’s “sleep-wake” circadian rhythm.  Your body produces more melatonin (the hormone that induces sleep) when you’re warm, so your body wants to go to sleep.  Second, warmth also triggers a process called “shivering thermogenesis,” which is when your body releases heat to maintain a constant body temperature.  Your body has to expend energy to generate heat, and this process uses up energy that could otherwise be used for other things, like keeping you awake.  Lastly, warm temperatures can cause you to sweat, which is another way your body is expending energy to cool itself.  This is a good thing to do if you’re exercising, but if you’re not exercising it can cause you to feel tired and lethargic.",

    "output": "Yes, it’s a good idea to create a separate presale contract.  The main contract would contain the main functionality for the Defi project, and the presale contract would be used for the private sale of tokens.  You can use the same main contract, and just add a new function to it to handle the private sale.  You’ll want to define the number of tokens to be sold in the presale, and also set a fixed price for each token.  You’ll want to make sure the presale contract is compliant with the regulatory guidelines for the jurisdiction where the project is being launched.  You’ll also want to make sure the contract has a way to release tokens to the public after the presale is complete, and that the public sale is conducted fairly and transparently.  The details of how to do all of this will depend on the specific smart contract platform you’re using.  It might be easiest to start with a template smart contract, and then modify it as needed.  You can also ask the development team for help with this.",

Next, you would create a “Game Scene”, which is where the majority of the gameplay takes place.  The “Game Scene” should include all the game elements and mechanics, and should also include a “Start” button to begin play.  Finally, you would create a “Game Over” scene, which is displayed when the player loses or quits the game.  The “Game Over” scene should display a message congratulating or consoling the player, and should also include a “Restart” button to return to the “Main Menu” scene.",

We need a balance of each of these types of foods in our diets.\n-Eating a variety of foods helps ensure that we get a balanced diet.  Most people eat far too much of certain foods and not enough of others.  Eating too much of one food, or not enough of another can lead to nutritional deficiencies or imbalances.\n-Some nutrients are essential, meaning that our bodies can’t make them and we have to get them from our diet.  Some essential nutrients are vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.  A balanced diet should include plenty of these essential nutrients.\n-Some nutrients are considered “healthy” because they’re linked with a reduced risk of chronic disease.  These nutrients include fiber, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  It’s important to eat plenty of these types of foods.\n-When you consume calories, not all of them are used for energy.  Some calories are lost as waste products (like carbon dioxide and water) and some calories are stored in the body as fat.  To maintain a healthy weight, you need to balance the calories you consume with the calories you burn.\n-Some people may not get all the nutrients they need from food alone.

Computer architecture is the logical organization and arrangement of the different components and subsystems that make up a computer system, including the CPU, memory, buses, I/O ports, and other hardware components.

Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?",
    "output": "Aikido is a martial art and an art of self-defense.  But it is also an art of harmony and peace.  Aikido techniques are a way of overcoming the aggression of the opponent, by blending with their attack and redirecting their energy.  So aikido is both about mastering a martial art and about developing one’s ability to resolve conflict peacefully.\n\nI think there is a great deal of overlap between the teachings of J Krishnamurti and the principles of aikido.  Krishnamurti was a proponent of self-development and self-realization, which he said were the most important things in life.  Aikido is a martial art, but it is also a way of life.  Aikido students learn to develop their spiritual side as they practice and develop their martial skills.\n\nI think the most important ideas from Krishnamurti’s teachings that relate to aikido are:\n\n* the idea of non-violence and not reacting to aggression,\n* the importance of spiritual development,\n* the importance of self-knowledge and self-understanding,\n* the idea that we must be in harmony with ourselves before we can be at peace with others.\n\nKrishnamurti was a great proponent of questioning everything and of self-inquiry.  I think this is very relevant to aikido practice, as it helps to challenge our own assumptions and preconceptions.  Aikido students learn to apply this kind of questioning in their practice, and also to apply it in their lives.\n\nIn terms of specific ideas",

If you want to create your own custom covers, you can print them on your own 3D printer.  You’ll need to make sure the base you buy is compatible with the 3D printing process you use, and you’ll also need to consider the materials you use.  It’s a good idea to check with the manufacturer of the base to see if they have any recommendations.  Once you have a 3D printed cover, you’ll need to attach it to the base.  Some bases have built-in mounts for this, but you might need to use other hardware, such as screws or adhesive.",

These challenges are limiting the potential for productivity growth and food security on the continent.  Addressing these challenges requires concerted policy action and investments in agricultural production and infrastructure.

The implementation: In an app for an online fast fashion e-commerce platform, the user uploads a video in which the whole body of the user is within frame and the user turns 360 degree. Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items.",

One common way to increase energy efficiency is to add additional panes of glass.  However, adding more panes of glass does not necessarily lead to greater energy efficiency.  It depends on the type of glass and insulating materials used in each pane.  In addition, the overall design of the window, such as how well the panes of glass fit together, is also important for energy efficiency.\n\nIn terms of your questions, a double pane window can potentially be more efficient than a triple pane window if the additional pane of glass is of a high quality and the overall design of the window is well-engineered.  Similarly, a single pane window can potentially be more efficient than a double pane window if the single pane of glass is of a high quality and the overall design of the window is well-engineered.

Research the problem and related topics, and write down key ideas.\n4.  Make a plan for how to solve the problem, including breaking it down into smaller steps.\n5.  Attempt to solve each step of the problem, one at a time, and see if you get any further.\n6.  If you get stuck on a particular step, back up and try a different approach.\n7.  If you still can’t solve the problem, try seeking help from someone who is more familiar with the topic.\n\nThis may not be an exhaustive list, but it should give you a good starting point for approaching new problems.  The most important thing is to be patient and persistent, and not to give up too easily.  With practice, you’ll develop more confidence in your ability to tackle new problems.",

With clicker training, you’ll use a clicker (a device that makes a clicking sound) to teach your cat new behaviors, like sitting or lying down, and then you’ll pair those behaviors with words in French, like “s’il vous plaît” (please) or “oui” (yes).  This method is really easy to start with, and you can even use it to teach your cat tricks!  You’ll want to be sure to start with really simple things like “sit” and “down,” and then move on to more complicated behaviors.  You’ll also want to make sure to keep your cat’s needs in mind, and make sure that you’re not overloading her with too much training all at once.  Clicker training is really great because it’s reward-based, so you’ll be able to give lots of positive reinforcement to your cat for learning new things.",

Finally, in the case of nudity that is not explicitly indecent, a person may still be charged with a misdemeanor if he or she intentionally or knowingly exposes his or her genitals in a place where other people might be present, or if the person intentionally or knowingly exposes his or her genitals in a manner that is offensive or provocative to another person.",

    "output": "Estimating the variance of a variable is a common statistical concept.  The variance is a measure of how much variation there is around the mean value of a data set.  To estimate the variance, we can use the formula:\n\nVariance = Sum (x - mean) ^2\n\nHere, x represents each data point in the data set, and the mean represents the average value of the data.  To estimate the variance, you need to first calculate the mean of the data set.  Then, you sum up the squared differences between each data point and the mean.  The variance is then calculated by taking the sum of these squared differences.  This formula works for any data set with a given number of observations.  There are also some specific statistical tests and techniques you can use to estimate the variance of a variable, but this formula is a simple and common method.",

However, a small portion of the genome is involved in determining physical appearance, such as skin color, eye color, and hair color.

Here are some strategies that might help you make the most of your limited practice time:\n\n-Try to focus your practice on the most difficult aspects of the language, and try to drill those concepts.\n-Try to vary your practice activities: focus on speaking, reading, writing, and listening.\n-Don’t be afraid to focus on specific vocabulary and grammar points that are giving you trouble, even if they aren’t part of the current lesson.\n-Keep a notebook to track your progress and to take notes during lessons, and review your notes regularly to keep things fresh in your mind.\n-Don’t feel like you need to be able to converse fluently in a foreign language right away.  The key to being able to speak the language well is practice and repetition, so keep at it even if you’re still making lots of mistakes.\n-Try to set a realistic goal for yourself, like being able to carry on a basic conversation or to read a short passage by the end of the month, and work toward that goal.\n-If you have the chance, try to find other language learners to practice with or to get feedback from, whether that’s other students in your language class or other language learners you find online.  Having someone to practice with and get feedback from can really help you improve more quickly.\n-Most importantly, have fun!

Polar bears have a thick layer of fur that traps air and insulates them from the cold, and they also have a layer of fat under their skin that acts as insulation.  They also keep warm by burning a lot of energy in the form of fat, and this is called “thermogenesis”.  This means they can actually generate their own heat by burning fat.  Finally, polar bears have special blood vessels in their feet and ears that close off and reduce blood flow to these areas when it gets too cold, which also reduces heat loss.  Overall, polar bears are well adapted to surviving in very cold environments.",

By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Kunji offers a secure, transparent, and decentralized investment platform that is highly scalable and offers significant cost savings compared to traditional hedge funds.\n\nKunji is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which offers a secure and immutable ledger of all investment transactions.  Kunji’s smart contracts automatically execute trades based on predefined rules and algorithms, eliminating the need for a centralized fund manager.  This decentralized model significantly reduces costs, and also offers increased security and transparency, as all investment transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain.\n\nKunji will initially offer investment strategies focused on trading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The fund will be accessible to a broad range of investors, with a minimum investment amount of $1000.  Kunji will generate returns through a combination of market trading strategies and passive crypto holdings.  We expect to generate annualized returns of approximately 20% on a fully invested portfolio, with lower returns in the early stages of fund launch.\n\nKunji is a pioneering initiative that offers a new model for investing in cryptocurrencies.  The decentralized fund model offers significant advantages over traditional hedge funds, including lower costs, increased security, and increased transparency.  We believe that Kunji has the potential to become a leading player in the emerging Decentralized hedge fund space.",

Here are some tips for you:\n\n  *  If your home is well insulated and your heating system is efficient, using gas may still be a good option.  On the other hand, if your home isn’t well insulated or your heating system isn’t very efficient, using electricity may be more cost-effective.  You can check the efficiency of your heating system by taking the temperature difference between the room with the radiator turned on and the room with the radiator turned off.  You can also consider having an energy audit done to see if there are any areas for improvement.\n  *  If you are using gas, make sure you keep your thermostat set to the right temperature.  You want to make sure you’re not overheating your home, as this will increase your costs.  Similarly, make sure you’re not keeping your thermostat too low, as this will lead to more energy use and costs.\n  *  If you are using electricity, make sure you’re using the right type of heaters for the space you’re heating.  Electric baseboard heaters can be more expensive to operate than radiant heaters or space heaters.  You can also consider getting a programmable thermostat to make it easier to adjust the temperature in different areas of your home.\n  *  Consider whether you",

    "output": "1) To learn Chinese characters, you need to start by memorizing the “radicals” (or “guaizi”) of the characters. Radicals are the key component of a character, and you can think of them as the “shorthand” for writing the character. After you learn the radicals, you can start to memorize the strokes for the characters, and practice writing them.\n\n2) To memorize Chinese characters, one common strategy is to associate each character with a “mnemonic image” (or “memory trigger”). You can think of a mnemonic image as a mental association or mental picture that helps you remember the character. For example, the character for “tree” (木) is associated with the image of a tree, and the character for “mountain” (山) is associated with the image of a mountain.\n\n3) Another common strategy is to practice writing the characters, both by handwriting and typing. The more you practice writing the characters, the better you will become at recognizing and recalling them.",

Green Arrow and Red Arrow then took her into custody.\n\nAs they were walking away from the scene, Green Arrow and Red Arrow began arguing about the way they handled the situation.  Green Arrow felt that they had done a good job of capturing Cheshire, but that Red Arrow had put them both in unnecessary danger by fighting her hand-to-hand.

This allows for more flexibility in implementation, but also makes it more difficult to optimize performance.\n\n-Can be less efficient, as interpreted languages often have an additional interpreter program that must be loaded and executed.\n\nCompiled languages: \n\n-Faster startup time, as the program must first be compiled before it can be executed.\n\n-Slower execution time, as the program must first be compiled before it can be executed.

    "output": "Yes, there is a simple formula for generating all primes, and the distribution of primes is indeed random.  The formula for generating primes is (2n) + 1, where n is any positive integer.  This formula works because all prime numbers must be greater than 1 and must be greater than the last prime number.  This formula works because it produces a sequence of numbers that always contains at least one prime number, but it does not guarantee that any particular number will be prime.  As for whether the distribution of primes is truly random, this is a highly debated topic in mathematics.  Many mathematicians believe that the distribution of primes is random, but others argue that there may be some underlying pattern that we haven't yet discovered.",

Landlords have many advantages: they own the property, they make the rules, they can increase the rent, they can decide to sell the property, and so on.  Tenants, on the other hand, have relatively few protections or rights, and are often at the mercy of the landlord.  This gives the landlord a significant power advantage.  From a moral perspective, this power imbalance is problematic, and could be considered unfair or unjust.

Walls and corners can weaken the signal.\n\n2)  If your router has an antenna, consider using an omnidirectional antenna, rather than a directional antenna.  Omnidirectional antennas broadcast the signal in all directions, while directional antennas focus the signal in a specific direction.  This can help cover a larger area with less dead spots.\n\n3)  Consider moving your router to a higher location, such as on a higher shelf or the ceiling.  This will help spread the signal farther and can also help avoid interference from electronic devices on lower shelves or the floor.\n\n4)  Add Wi-Fi extenders or range boosters to boost the signal in areas of weak coverage.  These devices can be plugged into an electrical outlet, and can help extend the signal from the router.\n\n5)  If you have thick walls or other types of obstacles in your home that are blocking the signal, consider using a Wi-Fi signal booster that can penetrate through walls.  This can help increase the signal strength and improve coverage in areas with poor reception.",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
    "output": "in the 18th century the architects Christopher Wren and Leonhard Euler independently developed analytical methods to solve for the geometry of curves.\n\nIn the 19th century, the mathematician Augustin Louis Cauchy contributed to the understanding of perspective in art. Other prominent contributions to the study of the relationship between mathematics and art have come from the mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss, Pierre Fatou, Felix Klein, and Roger Penrose. Modern work has applied advanced mathematics and theoretical physics to the study of visual art, for example in fractals, computer graphics, and non-Euclidean geometry.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
    "output": "weakens the model performance, which reveals the necessity of handling the noisy data to improve FSL performance. Finally, we propose a few-shot multi-task learning model and investigate the importance of different design choices. We hope that FewJoint can be a useful resource for future research.",

    "output": "Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging field of research that seeks to take advantage of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers.  Quantum computers are expected to greatly outperform classical computers on certain types of computationally intensive tasks, such as factoring large numbers or simulating quantum systems.  The basic principles of quantum computing involve encoding information into quantum bits (“qubits”) that can be in superposition states, which allow them to perform certain operations simultaneously.  Quantum algorithms are then able to take advantage of this quantum mechanical behavior to dramatically increase computational speed and efficiency.",

This is because a balloon is a relatively lightweight and buoyant material, and the amount of lift it provides is proportional to the volume of the gas inside it, which is a function of the pressure inside the balloon.  So if we take the average density of a house (say 1.5 tons per cubic meter), then the required volume of helium gas (which is the lifting gas in the balloons) will be approximately 500 to 1,000 cubic meters, which will be roughly 500 to 1,000 balloons.  This calculation is very approximate, but it should give you a rough idea of how many balloons would be required to lift a house like the one in the movie.",

    "output": "There are about 10 trillion snowflakes that fall during a typical winter.  Snowflakes form when water vapor cools to form ice crystals, which grow larger and become heavier as more water molecules freeze onto their surfaces.  The average snowflake has 6 sides, with a diameter of about 10 micrometers.  They are formed in clouds when ice crystals stick together as they fall, or when larger ice crystals freeze smaller ice crystals onto their surfaces.  As the snowflakes fall through the air, they melt slightly and then refreeze, forming more complex shapes.  This process results in snowflakes of varying shapes, sizes and patterns, which makes each snowflake unique.",

In fact, we can calculate the number of orbits of the Earth around the Sun since the beginning of life, and that number is approximately 1011.  Here’s how I would explain this:\n\nThe Earth has been revolving around the Sun for over 4.5 billion years, so since the beginning of life on Earth, the Earth has made about 1011 orbits of the Sun.  Here’s a breakdown of how I reached that number:\n\n- I multiplied 4.5 billion years by 365 days in a year, and then multiplied that result by 24 hours in a day, and then multiplied that result by 60 minutes in an hour, and then multiplied that result by 60 seconds in a minute, and then divided by 3600 seconds in an hour.  This gave me the number of days the Earth has been revolving around the Sun.\n\n- I then divided the number of days by the number of orbits around the Sun that the Earth makes each day.  This gave me the number of orbits around the Sun that the Earth has made since the beginning of life.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!  This is a really interesting and fun fact to think about.",

On the one hand, streaming platforms have made it easier for artists to reach listeners around the world, which has helped to increase both visibility and sales.  However, streaming platforms have also had negative impacts on the industry, particularly for established artists.  The new revenue models used by streaming platforms often leave artists with smaller payments than they would receive from traditional record sales, and artists often have little control over how their music is promoted or shared on streaming platforms.  Overall, the impact of streaming platforms on the music industry has been significant, and it will continue to be a major focus of industry discussion moving forward.\n\nConclusion: Streaming platforms have had a dramatic impact on the music industry, and the impact is likely to continue to grow in the coming years.  Streaming platforms have made it easier for artists to reach listeners around the world, but they also leave artists with less control over their work and smaller payments than they would receive from traditional record sales.  As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see more innovation and change in the way music is made and distributed.",

Overall the orchestra played the piece with a great deal of energy and accuracy, with the strings especially playing very well together.  The audience was quite enthusiastic throughout the performance, and at the end there were several enthusiastic rounds of applause.  The orchestra certainly put on a very entertaining and well-executed performance.
